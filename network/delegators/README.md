# Delegators

**DRAFT**!





It is important to note that delegators are not subject to slashing or other punishments.



Numerous tools have been created by the community for calculating rewards; you'll find a collection of them organized in the [Community Guides collection](https://www.notion.so/Community-Guides-abbb10f4dba040d5ba81648ca093e70c). You can also find an up to date list of tools in the \#delegators and \#indexers channels on the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/vtvv7FP).



### Distribution of indexing rewards

Indexing rewards are collected and distributed whenever Indexers close their allocations. While they are active, allocations keep accruing rewards continuously. Indexers can either force close their allocations manually or let them be closed automatically after the maximum allocation lifetime \(every 28 epochs\). 

> 1 epoch = ~24 hours
