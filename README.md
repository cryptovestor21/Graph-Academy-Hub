# Welcome to The Graph

Welcome to The Graph **Community Documentation**. [The Graph](https://thegraph.com/) is an Web3 indexing protocol for querying networks like Ethereum, Uniswap, Aave, Synthetix and IPFS. Anyone can build and publish open APIs, called subgraphs, making data easily accessible. If you need help getting started or if you have a question, this is the right place for you. You can find the official documentation here: [The Graph Docs](https://thegraph.com/docs/). 

You can find answers to frequently asked questions in this [FAQ](faq-about-the-graph.md).
