# Content template GitHub

## Hello fellow contributor, we're glad to have you!

### Please use this template as a guide when creating pages for The Graph Academy Hub.

All pages use Markdown \(a cheat sheet for this can be found [here](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)\) so be sure to use `.md` as the extension when creating the page file. If you do not wish to use markdown, you can also use [Editor.md](https://pandao.github.io/editor.md/en.html) a open-source online markdown editor.
